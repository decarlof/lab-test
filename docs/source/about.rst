**LabControl** lib is a suite of tools initially developed for the Optimal Imaging and Tomography group, University of Trieste/Elettra sincrotone, and based on earlier code developed in the X-ray Nano-Imaging Group, at the University of Southampton. See below for a list of contributors.

This version is not a stand-alone package, but provides the tools for laboratory management. A custom laboratory control package has to import the library and, through the `init()` function, provide the basic configuration parameters needed for the proper functioning of the package.
